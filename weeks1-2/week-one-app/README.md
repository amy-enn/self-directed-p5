## Practice App: Landscape Generator

Concept: An interactive canvas where users can design their own landscape scene by placing premade shapes like a sun, hills, trees, and clouds.


Steps:

1. **Set Up A Responsive Canvas:** Initialize a P5.js sketch with a canvas that adjusts its size with the browser window.

2. **Create Draw() Functions:** Functions for each landscape element, e.g., drawSun(x, y), drawHill(x, y), drawCloud(x, y), etc.

3. **Color Parameter:** Pass color parameters to the draw() functions.

4. **Mouse Click Event:** Place the selected shape where the user clicks on the canvas.

5. **Shape Selection:** Create a UI (legend) for selecting different landscape elements.

6. **Shape Customization:** Use sliders? to adjust properties like size and color of the selected shape.  Thinking 3 sizes for each (s, m, l)?

7. **Additional Controls:**
* Clear Button: To reset the canvas.
* Save Button: To download the created landscape as an image.

### Technologies Used

- **P5.js**: For rendering the canvas and creating interactive graphics.

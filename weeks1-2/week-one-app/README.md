### Practice App: Landscape Generator
An interactive canvas where users can design their own landscape scene by placing premade shapes like a sun, hills, trees, and clouds.

Steps:

1. **Set Up A Responsive Canvas:** Initialize a P5.js sketch with a canvas that adjusts its size with the browser window.

2. **Create Draw() Functions:** Functions for each landscape element, e.g., drawSun(x, y), drawHill(x, y, size), drawCloud(x, y, size), etc.

3. **Color and Size Parameters:** Allow customization by passing size or color parameters to the draw() functions.

4. **Mouse Click Event:** Implement functionality to place the selected shape where the user clicks on the canvas.

5. **Shape Selection:** Create a UI for selecting different landscape elements. This could be a simple menu or clickable icons representing each shape.

6. **Shape Customization:** Implement sliders or input fields to adjust properties like size and color of the selected shape.  Thinking 3 sizes for each (s, m, l).

7. **Additional Controls:**
* Clear Button: To reset the canvas.
* Save Button: To download the created landscape as an image.

8. **Advanced Features (for future implementation):**
* Animations: Add elements like a moving sun or drifting clouds.
* Day and Night Cycle: Allow switching between day and night themes.
* Random Landscape Generator: A feature to generate a random landscape scene.

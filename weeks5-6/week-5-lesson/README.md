# Weeks 5-6
## Data Viz x Recursion X Art?

#### I didn't have very much fun with my last unit on data viz so I'm going to try to make this unit more artistic than I initially planned. 

**Objective**: Make more artistic data visualizations such as fractals maybe, phylogenetic trees, maybe using some local maritime data or datasets of natural phenomena (volcanic activity, etc).  I also need to review recursion for this unit as several of the viz types I picked will require a good understanding of it.

#### Preparation: Review recursion in P5.js via examples from the [P5.js examples archive](https://p5js.org/examples/)


### Some viz I want to try in this unit:
* Dendrogram: Good for visualizing natural hierarchies, such as the classification of species or the structure of ecosystems.

* Phylogenetic Tree: Can be used for exploring the evolutionary relationships between species, maybe this is where I can do the pan and zoom to explore different branches.

* Map-based artistic displays

* Animated or moving visualization if I have time - might be interesting to see waves and sine functions, for example, in motion...

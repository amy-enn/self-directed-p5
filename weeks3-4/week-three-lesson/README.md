# P5.js Learning Plan - Week Three
**Required:**
* A javascript IDE (VSCode)
* Node.js installed

---

### Create Basic Chart Types (Line, Bar, and TBD)
**Objective:** Understand basic data visualization in p5.js using shapes and lines on the canvas coordinate system.  I'll start with a simple array of ints as a dataset to display.

#### Line Chart:
* Plotting points and connecting them with lines.

* Mapping data points to pixels on the screen.

#### Bar Chart:
* Draw rectangles and scale them according to data values. 

* Horizontal and vertical bar orientation.

#### Pie Chart:
* Use "circle math" to divide a pie chart into chunks that are reflective of the dataset.

* Placing text on the chart (since there are no axes)


### Experiment with Basic Interactivity
**Objective:** Add interactive elements to my charts to make them more informative and fun, such as hovers, tool tips, etc.  This will involve dynamically updating the canvas.

* Hovers: Maybe display data values or additional properties of the data point when hovering over a point.  

* Clicks: Changing the visualization on a mouse click (might do something novelty like changing the colors, etc).


~~### Learn Zoom and Pan Features~~

~~**Objective:** Zoom and pan can help users navigate through larger datasets and charts.~~

~~* Zoom: This might involve scaling the data points and adjusting the axes accordingly.~~

~~* Pan: Allowing the user to click and drag to move around a larger dataset.~~


~~### Complete a Small App with Basic Charts - TBD~~

~~- I'll probably choose two of the types of charts I did for this week~~

~~- Fetch data from an API or use a static JSON file~~

~~- Implement a hover tool tip, a click listener of some sort, either pan OR zoom, and responsiveness of the chart canvas~~

## Update:

Moving learning the pan and zoom features on a future unit; this one doesn't have a logical place to use the feature.

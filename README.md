# Self-Directed learning: P5.js

# Weeks 1-2
### P5.js & Initial Data Exploration

   *  Explore transformations and event handling (mouse and keyboard interactions, scrollwheel, timers, etc) in P5.js

   *  Complete a small (~4-6 hr) app practicing canvas setup, basic shapes, and the canvas coordinate system (I already have some practice with this and have some ideas in mind).

   *  Learn how to make a canvas responsive

   *  Find some potential sources for project data and get acquainted with their structure

   * Complete a small (~4-6 hr) app that practices the basics of canvas responsiveness, shape drawing, transformations, and event handling.


# Weeks 3-4
### Data Visualization Basics in p5.js

   *  Create a basic line chart, bar chart, and another basic chart type of my choice, with dummy data, using scales and P5's coordinate system

   *  Experiment with adding basic interactivity to a chart via hovers, clicks, etc.

   *  Learn zoom and pan features

   *  Complete a small (~4-6 hr) app that displays two different simple visualization types using fetched data.


# Weeks 5-6
### Data Viz x Recursion X Art?

#### I didn't have very much fun with my last unit on data viz so I'm going to try to make this unit more artistic than I initially planned. 

**Objective**: Make more artistic data visualizations such as dendrograms, fractals maybe, phylogenetic trees, maybe using some local maritime data or datasets of natural phenomena (volcanic activity, etc).  I also need to review recursion for this unit as several of the viz types I picked will require a good understanding of it.

#### Preparation: Review recursion in P5.js via examples from the [P5.js examples archive](https://p5js.org/examples/)


### Some viz I want to try in this unit:
* Dendrogram: Good for visualizing natural hierarchies, such as the classification of species or the structure of ecosystems.

* Phylogenetic Tree: Can be used for exploring the evolutionary relationships between species, maybe this is where I can do the pan and zoom to explore different branches.

* Time-Series Data Visualization: Showcasing changes over time.

* Animated or moving visualization if I have time - might be interesting to see waves and sine functions, for example, in motion...

Complete a small (~4-6 hr) app to practice this week's learning points and that includes some sort of dynamic update, such as:

realtime data updating
user interaction (hovers, clicks, etc)

# Weeks 7-9
### Integrating P5.js with React for Final Project
   * Use "react-p5-wrapper" to integrate P5.js into a React project (Vite)

   * Wireframe whimsical tidal data dashboard layout

   * Final selection of the charts, data, and visualizations I'd like to use
       - I will create probably 6 and select probably 4 for the deployment

   *  Start building the NS tidal data dashboard



### Build, Final Edits, & Deployment

   *  Complete the NS tidal data dashboard
   *  Complete documentation and README for the repo
   *  Deploy the dashboard (Vercel) and integrate into my portfolio
